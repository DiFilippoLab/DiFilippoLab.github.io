### Research

Our work in robotics focuses on how to get robots to make decisions and perceive their environments. Specifically we are focused on working in the following domains:

**Automated Disassembly**
Performing non-destructive disassembly is vastly different than assembling a product. During disassembly, a robot must reason about which product was presented to it, the condition of the product, the heirarchy of different parts of the product, the types of fasteners present, etc. This is often complicated by the fact many products with similiar functions can look the same (laptops, TVs) but have their parts structured differently. Our work looks at how robot can make sense of a product presented to it and how to model the disassembly process

**Robot Perception**

It is very challenging for a robot to make sense of its surroundings especially it is is performing some sort of tasks. As humans, we have feedback from our senses (touch, sight, hearing, etc) that help give feedback about if we are performing a task correctly. We are investigating ways to combine these methods, for example vision and force sensing, to help a robot perform various tasks.
