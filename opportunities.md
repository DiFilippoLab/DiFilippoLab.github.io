### Undergraduate Students
Our lab is often seeking highly motivated undergraduate students to assist with research projects, however, there are a limited number of positions available.
Students should contact Prof. DiFilippo for more information and how this research opportunity could potentially be used to satisfy degree requirements. If you have not had Prof. DiFilippo in class, please include as much information as possible in your email (CV, transcript, reason why you would like to join the lab, etc.) and I will reach out to you if we have a research opportunity that might be a good fit with your interests/profile.
